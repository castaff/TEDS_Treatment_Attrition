All code to recreate the main analysis, and and figures found in "Identifying Key Risk Factors for Premature Discontinuation of Opioid Use Disorder Treatment in the United States: a Predictive Modeling Study" 
can be found in the file "TEDSTidyModelsWorkflow.R"

All raw data can be found at https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/study-series/treatment-episode-data-set-discharges-teds-d-nid13520

Both the combined, and full (nonmissing) data sets can be found in this repository as well, entitled tedsnonmissing.rda and combined_teds.rda

All thoughts and suggestions are welcome! 

Thank you.
